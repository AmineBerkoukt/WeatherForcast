## üìä How It Works

1. **Scraping Weather Data**  
   - The backend uses **Cheerio** and **Axios** to scrape weather forecast data from a weather website.
   - The data contains information like date, temperature, and weather conditions for each day.
   
2. **Storing Data in MongoDB**  
   - The scraped data is stored in a **MongoDB** database using **Mongoose**.
   - The data includes maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the weather conditions (e.g., "Sunny", "Rainy").
   
3. **Displaying Data with React**  
   - The **React** frontend fetches the weather data via an API created with **Express.js**.
   - Weather data is displayed in a clean and simple interface using **Material-UI** components.
